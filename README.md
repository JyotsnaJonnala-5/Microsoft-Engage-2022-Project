 Face Recognition on Preventing crime.
This is a small application of running face recognition on live video from your webcam.
It detect faces in every other frame of video.
To build this application we need some requirements -- mainly the cv2 library should be installed to read from your webcam and face recognition PyPI world's simplest face recognition library recognize and manipulate faces.
I taken two sample pictures and created arrays of known face encodings and their names.
If match was found it gives output as their names which was saved in record data if match was not found it say unknown.
